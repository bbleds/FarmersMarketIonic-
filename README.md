# Aril

Aril is a locator app built using the Ionic framework, Angular.js, the Google Maps API, and the USDA National Farmers Market Directory API.

#Purpose & Goal

This app was one of my first experiences with Ionic. My overall goal was to
	1. Develop an app that integrated multiple APIs (one specifically being the Google Maps API)
	2. Gain a greater understanding connecting express with front-end (namely using proxies via express to resolve CORS issues)
	3. Gain Experience working with Angular, Ionic, Node, and Express.

#Features

Aril locates and plots the five closest farmers' markets to a devices location (via latitude and longitude). After the inital mapping of locations, Aril accepts zip code input from a user and plots the new locations relative to the zip code entered. In addition, a user is able to tap/click on a plotted location, see location/market details, and receive step by step directions from the current device location to the selected market location.
